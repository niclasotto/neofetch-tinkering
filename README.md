# neofetch-tinkering

To use the different neofetch versions, just copy them into the ```/usr/bin/``` folder and rename them to just "neofetch", then use ```chmod +x``` to make it executable.

You also need to change your Distro ASCII-Art from "auto" to "custom" in the config.conf file located in ```/home/.config/neofetch```

For anyone who doesn't want to go into the config file, I've included a modified config file that you just have to copy into ```/home/.config/```
